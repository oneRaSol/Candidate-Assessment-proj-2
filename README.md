- [Site layout](#markdown)
- [Site Features](#markdown-syntax-extensions)
  - [Login / Registration](#markdown-extended-mde)
  - [Quiz](#markdown-extended-mde)
  - [Resume upload](#multimarkdown-mmd)
  - [Admin results report](#markdown-extended-mde)

# Gathering stage

 The features for the app has been decided to allow the user to sign-up and login to the app before starting the Quiz. The results will be shown to them once completed. Candidates are also be encouraged to upload their resume for review. Therefore an executable platform is used for **1.:** Http request for storage of data and retrieval **2.:** for the uploading of files to a server folder.

## Issue left to be resolved

- **Stick footer**, Recognizing and celebrating success is a very powerful motivator for humans because it reinforces
   the meaning behind all that hard work and it shows appreciation for
   the achievements. This, in turn, boosts our self-esteem and it
   motivates us to take the next step towards achieving the next goal.

- **Json-server**, A pull request is outstanding regarding this issue created to resolver the posting of the test results to a data set.<!--START_SECTION:waka-->

- **ðŸ‘‰ PWA**, I Will apply this PWA after project is submitted due to time constraints.
